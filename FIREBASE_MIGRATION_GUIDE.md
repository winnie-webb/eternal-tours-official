# Firebase Migration Guide - Eternal Tours

## üöÄ Migration Complete!

Your Eternal Tours application has been successfully migrated from a static JSON file to Firebase Firestore. Here's what's been implemented:

## ‚úÖ What's Changed

### 1. **API Routes (Firebase Integration)**

- `GET /api/products` - Fetch all products from Firestore
- `POST /api/products` - Create new product in Firestore
- `GET /api/products/[id]` - Get single product by ID
- `PUT /api/products/[id]` - Update existing product
- `DELETE /api/products/[id]` - Delete product
- `GET|POST|DELETE /api/migrate` - Migration utilities

### 2. **Admin Portal Enhancements**

- ‚úÖ Real-time product management (Add, Edit, Delete)
- ‚úÖ Migration status dashboard
- ‚úÖ Improved UI with proper forms
- ‚úÖ Error handling and feedback
- ‚úÖ Firebase data synchronization

### 3. **Components Updated**

- ‚úÖ `Category.jsx` - Now fetches from Firebase with loading states
- ‚úÖ `SearchBar.jsx` - Async search with debouncing
- ‚úÖ Product pages - Server-side Firebase integration
- ‚úÖ Homepage - Uses categoryFilter for efficiency

### 4. **Utilities Updated**

- ‚úÖ `product.js` - Async functions for Firebase operations
- ‚úÖ Caching layer for performance
- ‚úÖ Backwards compatibility maintained

### API Usage

#### **Fetch Products (Client-side):**

```javascript
import {
  getAllProducts,
  filterProductByCategory,
} from "@/app/products/product";

// Get all products
const products = await getAllProducts();

// Get products by category
const tourProducts = await filterProductByCategory("mpt");
```

#### **Direct API Calls:**

```javascript
// Get all products
const response = await fetch("/api/products");
const products = await response.json();

// Create new product
const response = await fetch("/api/products", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify(productData),
});

// Update product
const response = await fetch(`/api/products/${productId}`, {
  method: "PUT",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify(updatedData),
});

// Delete product
const response = await fetch(`/api/products/${productId}`, {
  method: "DELETE",
});
```

## üîÑ Migration Utilities

### Check Migration Status:

```bash
GET /api/migrate
```

### Migrate All Products:

```bash
POST /api/migrate
```

### Clear All Products (for testing):

```bash
DELETE /api/migrate
```

## üèóÔ∏è Data Structure

Each product in Firestore has the following structure:

```json
{
  "id": "mpt-1",
  "title": "Product Title",
  "desc": "Product Description",
  "priceLowest": "25.00",
  "priceHighest": "50.00",
  "category": "mpt",
  "imageExtension": "webp",
  "priceFalmouth": "30",
  "priceLucea": "35",
  // ... other location prices
  "createdAt": "2024-10-18T10:30:00Z",
  "updatedAt": "2024-10-18T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## üö® Important Notes

1. **Backwards Compatibility:** The old `products.json` is still used as a fallback
2. **Caching:** Products are cached client-side for performance
3. **Error Handling:** All components have proper error states
4. **Loading States:** UI shows loading indicators during data fetching
5. **Migration Safety:** Migration won't overwrite existing Firebase data

## üîí Security

- All write operations require Firebase Authentication
- Admin routes are protected
- API routes include proper error handling
- Input validation on all forms

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Test the migration** in your development environment
2. **Verify all products** appear correctly in admin panel
3. **Test product creation/editing** workflows
4. **Deploy to production** when ready
5. **Monitor Firebase usage** and costs

## üì± User Experience

- **Frontend users** will see no difference in functionality
- **Admin users** get enhanced management capabilities
- **Real-time updates** when products are modified
- **Better performance** with caching and optimized queries

Your app is now ready for dynamic product management! üéâ
